# Goal

The goal of this season is to Optimize

## Repo Structure

### Projects
Projects contain standalone, executable code that can be run independently of other projects. They are typically used to demonstrate a specific feature or functionality

### Libraries
Libraries contain reusable code that can be imported and used by other projects. They are typically used to provide common functionality or utilities that can be shared across multiple projects.
